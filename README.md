💧 Smart Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

Access to safe drinking water is a global necessity. Contaminated water can cause serious health problems, making it vital to predict water quality effectively. This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model that predicts whether water is Safe (Potable) or Unsafe based on its physical and chemical properties.

🎯 Objective

To predict water potability (0 = Not Safe, 1 = Safe) using machine learning models.

To preprocess the dataset for high-quality analysis and model performance.

To lay the foundation for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model building.

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Water Potability Dataset

Features: pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfates, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity

Target: Potability (0 = Not Safe, 1 = Safe)

⚙️ Workflow (Completed Till Now)

✔️ Problem Definition – Defined the scope and objective of the project
✔️ Library Import – Loaded essential Python libraries for ML & visualization
✔️ Data Collection – Uploaded dataset, checked structure, summary statistics, missing values, duplicates
✔️ Data Preprocessing

Converted data types

Handled missing values with median imputation

Removed duplicates

Detected & treated outliers using IQR method

Scaled features with StandardScaler

Balanced target classes using SMOTE

Split dataset into 70% Training and 30% Testing

📊 Next Steps

🔹 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
🔹 Train multiple Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
🔹 Compare performance and select best model
🔹 Deploy as a Web App (Flask/Streamlit)

🚀 Current Status

🟢 Data preprocessing completed successfully.
📌 Ready to move forward with EDA and Model Building.

✨ This repository will be updated as the project progresses.
